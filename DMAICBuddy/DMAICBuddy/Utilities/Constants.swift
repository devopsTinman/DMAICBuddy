<h1>Project Charter </h1>
<p>
A project charter is the first step in the Six Sigma methodology. This document should specify necessary resources and boundaries that will ensure success. The project charter should assist the team by providing focus and motivation.
</p>
<h2>Necessary Project Charter Areas</h2>
<h3>Project Title</h3>
<p>
Short Title of the project.
</p>
<h3>Start Date</h3>
<p>
Date the project formally started
</p>
<h3>Anticipated End Date</h3>
<p>
Date the project intends to complete
</p>
<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>
The problem statement will address what is working and what's not working. It should discuss the finanical impact and any effect on customers or employees. The problem statement should also point out frequency and when and where the problem occurs.
</p>
<h3>Business Case</h3>
<p>The business case should describe why this project is worth executing. It should also describe why it is important to do now and what are the consequences of not doing a project. Additionally, the business case should describe how the project fits in with company initiatives and objectives.
</p>
<h3>Goal Statement</h3>
<p>
The goal statement is a one liner that should be very specific such as: &quot;Decrease mean time to resolution (MTTR) from 30 minutes to a target of 20 minutes within 6 months.
</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>
The timeline is typically a table that lays out the 5 phases of the DMAIC process noting the Planned date and the actual date in table format.
</p>
<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>The scope section should show the process steps that are in-scope. There should also be notes regarding other in-scope and out-of-scope items.
</p>
<h3>Team Members</h3>
<p>The team members section should show all of the parties that will be involved in the project. You should ensure to include all the team members, the team lead, any sponsors and any stakeholders. </p>

<h1>SIPOC</h1>
<p>
SIPOC (suppliers, inputs, process, outputs, customers) is a visual tool for documenting a business process from beginning to end. SIPOC (pronounced sigh-pock) diagrams are also referred to as high level process maps because they do not contain much detail. Some organizations use the opposite acronym COPIS, which puts the customer first and illustrates the value of the customer to the organization.
</p>
<p>
The term SIPOC originates from the 1980s and is part of the total quality movement. Today you'll find SIPOC as a part of the Six Sigma, Lean manufacturing and business process management disciplines.
</p>
<h3>Steps to Complete the SIPOC Diagram</h3>
<p>
SIPOC diagrams are very easy to complete. Here are the steps you should follow:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an area that will allow the team to post additions to the SIPOC diagram. This could be a transparancy (to be projected by an overhead) made of the provided template, flip charts with headings (S-I-P-O-C) written on each, or headings written on post-it notes posted to a wall.</li>
<li>Begin with the process. Map it in four to five high level steps.</li>
<li>Identify the outputs of this process.</li>
<li>Identify the customers that will receive the outputs of this process.</li>
<li>Identify the inputs required for the process to function properly.</li>
<li>Identify the suppliers of the inputs that are required by the process.</li>
<li>Optional: Identify the preliminary requirements of the customers. This will be verified during a later step of the Six Sigma measurement phase.</li>
<li>Discuss with project sponsor, Champion and other involved stakeholders for verification.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Stakeholder Assessment </h1>
<p>
A Stakeholder Analysis enables you to outline who has a vested interest in how a process performs. Remember that stakeholders do not receive the product or service. It helps you determine how and when to reach out and communicate with stakeholders to build buy-in, which is critical to a project's success.
</p>
<p>
A good way to analyze your stakeholders buy-in and reaction is through a simple spreadsheet listing the stakeholder, their role, support, influence, anticipated reaction and motivation

<h1>Voice of the Customer (VOC), Voice of the Business (VOB) and Critical to Quality (CTQ)</h1>
<p>
The "voice of the customer" is a process used to capture the stated and unstated needs and wants from the internal or external customer. This is used customers with a high quality service or product quality.
</p>
<p>
A customer need is an expectation from a given product or service. In contrast, a customer want is something that is often nice to have and may be vague. Needs are important critical features and wants are expectations of the product or service over and beyond needs. If a product or service does not have what the customer needs, he or she simply won't use it. If a product or service does not have what a customer wants, then the customer may be displeased but still use the product.
</p>
<h3>
Translating Voices to Needs
</h3>
<p>
The Voice of Customer (VOC) methodology can be used to capture the customer needs and translate comments into customer needs. The methods can be any of the following: Surveys, Interviews, Focus Group, Suggestions, Observations
</p>
<h3>
Distinct Categories of VOC
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Voice of Associate: The feedback that we get from our Employees</li>
<li>Voice of Investor: The feedback that we get from our Management and Shareholders</li>
<li>Voice of Customer: The feedback that we get from our Clients and End-customers</li>
<li>Voice of Process: The feedback that we get from measuring our CTPs (Critical To Process) and CTQs (Critical To Quality)</li>

<h1>Cause and Effect Diagram and Matrix</h1>
<p>
When utilizing a team approach to problem solving, there are often many opinions as to the problem's root cause. One way to capture these different ideas and stimulate the team's brainstorming on root causes is the cause and effect diagram, commonly called a fishbone. The fishbone will help to visually display the many potential causes for a specific problem or effect. It is particularly useful in a group setting and for situations in which little quantitative data is available for analysis.
</p>
<p>
The fishbone has an ancillary benefit as well. Because people by nature often like to get right to determining what to do about a problem, this can help bring out a more thorough exploration of the issues behind the problem - which will lead to a more robust solution.
</p>
<p>
To construct a fishbone, start with stating the problem in the form of a question, such as "Why is the help desk's abandon rate so high?" Framing it as a "why" question will help in brainstorming, as each root cause idea should answer the question. The team should agree on the statement of the problem and then place this question in a box at the "head" of the fishbone.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the fishbone then consists of one line drawn across the page, attached to the problem statement, and several lines, or "bones," coming out vertically from the main line. These branches are labeled with different categories. The categories you use are up to you to decide. There are a few standard choices:
<ul>
<li>Determine Customers</li>
<li>Advertise Product</li>
<li>Incent Purchase</li>
<li>Sell Product</li>
<li>Ship Product</li>
<li>Provide Upgrade</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Once you have the branches labeled, begin brainstorming possible causes and attach them to the appropriate branches. For each cause identified, continue to ask "why does that happen?" and attach that information as another bone of the category branch. This will help get you to the true drivers of a problem.
</p>
<p>
Once you have the fishbone completed, you are well on your way to understanding the root causes of your problem. It would be advisable to have your team prioritize in some manner the key causes identified on the fishbone. If necessary, you may also want to validate these prioritized few causes with a larger audience.

<h1>Measurement Systems Analysis</h1>
<p>
An experimental and mathematical method of determining how much the variation within the measurement process contributes to overall process variability. There are five parameters to investigate in an MSA: bias, linearity, stability, repeatability and reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
A general rule of thumb for measurement system acceptability is:
<ul>
<li>Under 10 percent error is acceptable.</li>
<li>>10 percent to 30 percent error suggests that the system is acceptable depending on the importance of application, cost of measurement device, cost of repair, and other factors.</li>
<li>Over 30 percent error is considered unacceptable, and you should improve the measurement system. AIAG also states that the number of distinct categories the measurement systems divides a process into should be greater than or equal to 5.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In addition to percent error and the number of distinct categories, you should also review graphical analyses over time to decide on the acceptability of a measurement system.

<h1>Value Stream Mapping</h1>
<p>
The map begins with the first step in the process, typically the step that triggers the process such as the customer giving an order or the receipt of the order or request from the customer.  The process ends with the completion of the activity usually manifest in delivery of the customer order or delivery of the unit to the downstream process.
</p>
<p>
A Value Stream Map can incorporate an enterprise from receipt of a customer order to delivery of the product to the customer or comprise sub-processes within this larger, big picture context.  For example, a continuous improvement process might be commissioned to examine the Underwriting process within insurance company.  The beginning of the Value Stream Map might commence at receipt of the request for a policy by the underwriting group and end at the decision to issue or deny the policy.  Ideally, every enterprise/company would want a Value Stream Map from end-to-end capturing the customer order to the final delivery of the product or service to the customer.

Process sigma (also referred to as sigma level) is a measure of process capability:  the higher the process sigma, the more capable the process is.  A Six Sigma process has a short-term process sigma of 6, and a long-term process sigma of 4.5 (see why not 4.5 sigma?).  The theoretical defect rate for a Six Sigma process is 3.4 defects per million (DPM).

<h1>Hypothesis Testing</h1>
<p>
Hypothesis testing tells us whether there exists a statistically significant difference between the data sets for us to consider that they represent different distributions.
</p>
<p>
For Continuous data, hypothesis testing can detect Difference in Average and Difference in Variance. For Discrete data, hypothesis testing can detect Difference in Proportion Defective.
</p>
<h3>Steps in Hypothesis Testing</h3>
<ol>
<li>Determine appropriate Hypothesis test</li>
<li>State the Null Hypothesis Ho and Alternate Hypothesis Ha</li>
<li>Calculate Test Statistics / P-value against table value of test statistic</li>
<li>Interpret results - Accept or reject Ho</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Mechanism</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ho = Null Hypothesis - There is No statistically significant difference between the two groups</li>
<li>Ha = Alternate Hypothesis - There is statistically significant difference between the two groups</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Hypothesis Testing Errors</h3>
<p>
Type I Error ' P (Reject Ho when Ho is true) = alpha<br />
In type I Error, we reject the Null Hypothesis when it is true. It is also called as Alpha error or Producer's Risk.
</p>
<p>
Type II Error - P (Accept Ho when Ho is false) = beta<br />
Similarly, in type II Error, we accept Null Hypothesis when it is false. It is also called as Beta error or Consumer's Risk.
</p>
<p>
P Value - Also known as Probability value, it is a statistical measure which indicates the probability of making an alpha error. The value ranges between 0 and 1. We normally work with 5% alpha risk, a p value lower than 0.05 means that we reject the Null hypothesis and accept alternate hypothesis.

<h1>Regression Analysis</h1>
<p>
Regression Analysis is a technique used to define relationship between an output variable and a set of input variables. It establishes the relationship 'Y' variable and 'x' variable mathematically, so that with known values of 'x', 'y' variable can be predicted.
</p>
<p>
There are several types of regression like Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Curvilinear Regression, Logit Regression and Probit Regression etc., which caters to a variety of requirements based on the type of underlying data.
</p>
<h3>Terminologies in Regression Analysis</h3>
Before understanding how to perform a regression analysis, let us understand the key terminologies involved.
<ul>
<li>Coefficients: These are the intercept (b0) and slopes (b1, b2,...,bn) of individual input variables. The values of these coefficients are extremely important in determining the Regression Equation. They are also, one of the key outputs of a Regression Analysis.</li>
<li>Standard Error (SE): Most software packages provide this value SE, when performing a Regression Analysis. It denotes the standard deviation of the Residual values from the Regression line. A good model should try to reduce the Standard Error.</li>
<li>Coefficient of Determination (r2): This value denotes how good and efficient the regression equation is, in predicting the y value. Typically, r2 values range from 0 to 1; 0 denoting a worst model and 1 denoting the best model. Higher is the r2 value, better is the prediction. Often, for Multiple Regression, another value known as r2adj is calculated. This value is different from r2 by eliminating the effect of multiple interrelated variables (Multicollinearity).</li>
<li>Multicollinearity: It is a condition denoting the input variables being strongly correlated. In such a condition, this correlation may mask another input variable's significance in the prediction. So, to avoid this, before proceeding to Regression, a Correlation Matrix for all the input variables is plotted and the masking effect is identified. Any one of the pair of variables with strong correlation is removed based on the business knowledge of the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How to Perform a Regression Analysis?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Identify the relevant input variables and collect data on all the input variables and output variable.</li>
<li>Select the suitable regression model (Simple Regression, Multiple Regression etc)</li>
<li>Calculate r2 value. Now a days a lot of software packages, add-ins are available to perform the entire calculation and analysis.</li>
<li>Assess the p value for each of the input variables (p-value less than the confidence level considered indicates that the variable is a useful predictor). Remove any variables with p-value > confidence level.</li>
<li>Test the variables for Multicollinearity and remove duplicate variables.</li>
<li>Develop the predictor equation with significant and shortlisted variables only.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Design of Experiments</h1>
<p>
The objective of Design of Experiments (DOE) is to Establish optimal process performance by finding the right settings for key process input variables. Design of Experiments is a way to intelligently form frameworks to decide which course of action you might take. This is helpful when you are trying to either sort out what factors impact a process.
</p>
<p>
Full Factorial Design is a thorough an exhaustive way of determining how each factor or combination of factors affects the outcome of an experiment.
</p>

Finally there is Partial (or Fractional) Factorial Design. Often doing a full factorial design analysis is impossible or impractical. Here’s how you can optimize your resources and still achieve a rigorously-supported decision.

<h1>Control Charts</h1>
<p>
Control charts have two general uses in an improvement project.
</p>
<ul>
<li>As a tool to monitor process stability and control.</li>
<li>As an analysis tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When a process is stable and in control, it displays common cause variation, variation that is inherent to the process. A process is in control when based on past experience it can be predicted how the process will vary (within limits) in the future. If the process is unstable, the process displays special cause variation, non-random variation from external factors.
</p>
<p>
Control charts are simple, robust tools for understanding process variability.
</p>
<h3>The Four Process States</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ideal - When a process operates in the ideal state, that process is in statistical control and produces 100 percent conformance. This process has proven stability and target performance over time. This process is predictable and its output meets customer expectations.</li>

<li>Threshold - A process that is in the threshold state is characterized by being in statistical control but still producing the occasional nonconformance. This type of process will produce a constant level of nonconformances and exhibits low capability. Although predictable, this process does not consistently meet customer needs.</li>

<li>Brink of Chaos - The brink of chaos state reflects a process that is not in statistical control, but also is not producing defects. In other words, the process is unpredictable, but the outputs of the process still meet customer requirements. The lack of defects leads to a false sense of security, however, as such a process can produce nonconformances at any moment. It is only a matter of time.</li>

<li>State of Chaos - The fourth process state is the state of chaos. Here, the process is not in statistical control and produces unpredictable levels of nonconformance.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Every process falls into one of these states at any given time, but will not remain in that state. All processes will migrate toward the state of chaos.
</p>
<h3>Elements of a Control Chart</h3>
<p>
There are three main elements of a control chart
</p>
<ol>
<li>Begins with a time series graph.</li>
<li>Process Location - A central line (X) is added as a visual reference for detecting shifts or trends</li>
<li>Process Dispersion - Upper and lower control limits (UCL and LCL) are computed from available data and placed equidistant from the central line</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Control Charts for Continuous Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Individuals and Moving Range Chart (I-MR)- applicable when one data point is collected at each point in time</li>

<li>The I chart is used to detect trends and shifts in the data, and thus in the process. The individuals chart must have the data time-ordered</li>

<li>The MR chart shows short-term variability in a process - an assessment of the stability of process variation. The moving range is the difference between consecutive observations</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The I-MR chart is best used when
</p>
<ul>
<li>The natural subgroup size is unknown.</li>
<li>The integrity of the data prevents a clear picture of a logical subgroup.</li>
<li>The data is scarce (therefore subgrouping is not yet practical).</li>
<li>The natural subgroup needing to be assessed is not yet defined.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Other Charts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Xbar-Range Charts - Like the I-MR chart, it is comprised of two charts used in tandem. The Xbar-R chart is used when you can rationally collect measurements in subgroups of between two and 10 observations. Each subgroup is a snapshot of the process at a given point in time. The chart's x-axes are time based, so that the chart shows a history of the process.</li>

<li>R chart - Plots the ranges of each subgroup. The R chart is used to evaluate the consistency of process variation. Look at the R chart first; if the R chart is out of control, then the control limits on the Xbar chart are meaningless.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Poka Yoke</h1>
<p>
Poka Yoke comes from Japan and was introduced by Shigeo Shingo to Toyota as a part of the production system. The word Poka means 'inadvertent mistake' and Yoke means 'prevention'. It's not about finding or correcting mistakes in a process but preventing them from ever being made. Poka Yoke is used to design processes so that defects are almost impossible.
</p>

<h3>THE FIVE STEPS</h3>
A Poke Yoke comprises five steps:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Describe the defect</li>
<li>Where is the defect caused? Go and see, go to the Gemba. Gemba means work floor. This is the place where the process is carried out and where the root causes of the defect can be found</li>
<li>Analyse the process in which the defect is found</li>
<li>What is the underlying reason for the defect? Go and look for that root cause</li>
<li>Devise a solution and implement Poka Yoke. Make sure that the defect cannot be made again in the future.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>THREE TYPES OF POKA YOKE</h3>
There are three types of Poke Yoke:

<ol>
<li>Visual aids: these can be seen and visualise the way of working. It might be a traffic sign, for example, which shows the direction you have to travel.</li>
<li>Visual management aids: these will 'signal' a warning in case of deviation and will thus direct behaviour, an example is a barrier, which stops you from going in a particular direction.</li>
<li>Failsafe: these will 'force' behaviour, for example, there is no another exit to arrive at particular destination.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>FREQUENTLY POKA YOKE TOOLS</h3>
Various Lean tools are used in Poka Yoke:
<ul>
<li>Process Mapping: a visual overview of the process within the organization</li>
<li>Five Whys: by asking why five times, you get closer to the heart of the problem and, ultimately, the solution</li>
<li>Go to the Gemba: Go to the work floor This is where the processes take place but it is also the defects arise</li>
<li>Cause and Effect Diagram: a tool for illustrating problems. It can be used to improve production processes and quality control</li>
<li>FMEA (Six Sigma tool): Failure Modes and Effects Analysis. A system that analyses the design of a product or service system and identifies possible errors. Action is then taken to prevent or minimalise them.</li>

<h1>Documentation </h1>
<p>
Documentation is a necessary step to insure that the learning gained via improvement is institutionalized and shared across the team by having it documented with proper work procedures. Often the live processes have a tendency to evolve in an ad-hoc manner.
</p>
<p>How to accomplish each process activity is usually left up to the individuals and thus, much of the organizational knowledge resides only in the minds of all those responsible for execution. Procedure: A procedure is the documented sequence of steps & other instructions necessary to carry out an activity for a process.
</p>
<p>At this point, the team updates their documentation: process maps, new procedures checklists, etc. The better their final documentation, the easier it is for process participants to adopt the new way of doing things. One of the most powerful methods of ensuring others follow the new process is to create a visual workspace. This means that anyone can see at a glance exactly how a process flows and where to find what they need.
